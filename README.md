Hi there, I'm Katlego! üëã

Aspiring Software Developer | Software Development Student

I'm a passionate and driven 2nd-year student diving deep into the world of software development. I thrive on building clean, efficient, and impactful solutions through code. My current focus is on mastering the .NET ecosystem and modern web development to create robust full-stack applications.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on: Sharpening my skills through academic projects and personal learning.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning: The powerful .NET stack, including C#, .NET Framework, Entity Framework, ASP.NET, MVC, and API development with Swagger, alongside frontend technologies like React.js, JavaScript/jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JSON.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on: Open-source or beginner-friendly C# and .NET projects, or any web development projects that can help me grow.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: When I'm not debugging code, you can find me on the soccer field ‚öΩ! I believe teamwork on the pitch translates well to collaboration in development.
